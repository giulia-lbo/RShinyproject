The app gets data from a EUROSTAT database (data downloaded from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/hlth_hlye/default/table?lang=en and stored in the .csv file). 
The data collected is on the distribution of healty life years across the EU (timespan: 2010-2019).
By selecting the country (or countries) of interest, the user filters out data and see the trends in healthy life years across the years or compare two different countries.
An interactive plot (interactive) is  shown to the user detailing the Healthy Life Years (along the years) or across the differnt EU countries.
